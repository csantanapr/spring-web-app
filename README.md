# Create and deploy a basic Java Spring application

> We have similar applications available for [Go](https://github.com/IBM/go-web-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-web-app), [Python Flask](https://github.com/IBM/flask-web-app), [Swift](https://github.com/IBM/swift-web-app), and [Node](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-web-app).

In this sample application, you will create a basic Java web application using Spring.  This provides a starting point for creating Java microservice applications running on [Spring](https://spring.io/). It contains no default application code, but comes with standard best practices, including a health check and application metric monitoring.

Capabilities are provided through dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.  The ports are set to the defaults of `8080` for http and `8443` for https in the `pom.xml` file.

The application exposes the following endpoints:
* Health endpoint: `<host>:<port>/health` e.g. http://localhost:8080/health
* Web content: `<host>:<port>`

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits/02b13105-f1ac-3350-b3de-23131ce11772/java-web-app-with-spring) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first.  Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

Use the button above to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud.  This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and devops toolchain.  You will have the option of deploying to either CloudFoundry or a Kubernetes cluster. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud. 


### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the IBM Cloud Developer Tools for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)
    
To build and run an application:
1. `mvn install`
1. `java -jar ./target/springstarter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

To run an application in Docker use the Docker file called `Dockerfile`. If you do not want to install Maven locally you can use `Dockerfile-tools` to build a container with Maven installed.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview) on your machine by using the following installation command: `curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash`.

The ports are set to the defaults of `8080` for http and `8443` for https and are exposed to IBM Cloud Developer Tools in the `cli-config.yml` file.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally.  When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on CloudFoundry or Kubernetes, run one of the commands below:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```

## Next Steps
* Learn more about augmenting your Java applications on IBM Cloud with the [Java Programming Guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/java).
* Explore other [sample applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits) on IBM Cloud.
